# CodeControl

Code Control is an educational semi-platformer game that is meant to help students hone and solidify their basic coding skills.

## Description

CodeControl is a drag and drop educational game that helps to teach basic coding skills. Students in their introductory computer science courses seem to drop at a rate of about a third because they have a hard time learning or honing their coding skills. Many students complain that in addition to the material being difficult, they can't find engaging ways to learn. CodeControl is a game that hopes to somewhat reduce this problem. It melds learning into a fun, simple game that can help intro students hone their coding skills.

In CodeControl, you take up the role as a robot named X839, who has the task of saving a plethora of scientists who are being  held captive on a spaceship. An unknown virus has taken over the ship and corrupted the ship's code. X839 must venture to verious parts of the ship in order to correct the code and save the scientists so they can make their escape from this wild ship.
